To build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that can process PDF files and respond to user queries as described, we'll break it down into a series of steps based on your functional requirements. Below is a structured approach to implementing this pipeline, followed by an example of extracting data from the provided document.

1. Data Ingestion
The first step involves extracting data from the PDFs, converting it into a usable format for the RAG pipeline.

a. Extract Text from PDFs
To begin, the text needs to be extracted from PDF files. There are several Python libraries, such as PyMuPDF, pdfminer, or PyPDF2, that can extract text. In this case, the text will be extracted from the input PDF and analyzed for structure.

python
Copy code
import fitz  # PyMuPDF

def extract_pdf_text(pdf_path):
    doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    text = ""
    for page_num in range(doc.page_count):
        page = doc.load_page(page_num)
        text += page.get_text()
    return text

pdf_path = "path/to/pdf_file.pdf"
pdf_text = extract_pdf_text(pdf_path)
b. Chunking the Extracted Text
The extracted text should be divided into logical chunks. You can segment the text into paragraphs or by identifying natural breaks (e.g., headers, tables).

python
Copy code
def chunk_text(text, chunk_size=1000):
    # Split text into chunks of the specified size
    chunks = [text[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(text), chunk_size)]
    return chunks

chunks = chunk_text(pdf_text)
c. Convert Text Chunks into Vector Embeddings
Use a pre-trained embedding model like Sentence-BERT or OpenAI's embedding models to convert text chunks into vector embeddings for efficient retrieval.

python
Copy code
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

embedding_model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

def embed_text(chunks):
    embeddings = embedding_model.encode(chunks)
    return embeddings

embeddings = embed_text(chunks)
d. Store Embeddings in a Vector Database
Store the vector embeddings in a vector database (such as FAISS, Pinecone, or Weaviate) for fast similarity search.

python
Copy code
import faiss

# Convert embeddings to a numpy array for FAISS compatibility
import numpy as np
embeddings_np = np.array(embeddings)

# Initialize FAISS index and add embeddings
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embeddings_np.shape[1])  # L2 distance metric
index.add(embeddings_np)
2. Query Handling
a. Convert User Query to Embedding
When a user submits a query, convert it to an embedding using the same model used for chunk embeddings.

python
Copy code
query = "What is the unemployment rate by degree type?"
query_embedding = embedding_model.encode([query])
b. Perform Similarity Search
Next, perform a similarity search in the vector database to retrieve the most relevant chunks based on the query embedding.

python
Copy code
# Perform similarity search in FAISS
k = 5  # Retrieve top 5 most relevant chunks
distances, indices = index.search(np.array(query_embedding), k)
relevant_chunks = [chunks[i] for i in indices[0]]
3. Comparison Queries
For comparison queries, such as asking for comparisons between different degree types across PDF files, you need to extract and compare relevant fields.

a. Identify Relevant Fields
This will depend on the structure of the PDF data. If the document contains tables, you can parse these tables and extract the relevant data points.

For example, if the query asks about unemployment rates across different degree types, extract the relevant data points from the PDF and aggregate them for comparison.

b. Retrieve Data and Aggregate
Retrieve the chunks that contain information about the degree types and unemployment rates and aggregate the results.

python
Copy code
# Example: Aggregating data for comparison
comparison_data = {
    "Degree Type": ["Bachelor's", "Master's", "PhD"],
    "Unemployment Rate": [4.5, 2.8, 1.2]  # hypothetical rates from the chunks
}
c. Generate a Structured Response
Once the data is retrieved and aggregated, generate a response (tabular or bullet-point format).

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

comparison_df = pd.DataFrame(comparison_data)
response = comparison_df.to_string(index=False)
4. Response Generation
Once the relevant information is retrieved from the vector database, use the LLM to generate a natural language response. You can inject the retrieved chunks into the prompt to ensure factuality.

python
Copy code
from openai import OpenAI

openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"

def generate_response(relevant_chunks, query):
    prompt = f"User query: {query}\n\nRelevant Information: {relevant_chunks}\n\nAnswer:"
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=200
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

response = generate_response(relevant_chunks, query)
Example Data: Extracting from the Provided PDF
To extract the exact unemployment data based on degree type from page 2 and the tabular data from page 6, the steps would involve:

Extracting the content from these specific pages.
Parsing the text to locate the unemployment information.
Extracting the tabular data and storing it in a structured format (e.g., CSV or table).
a. Extract Data from Specific Pages (e.g., Page 2 and Page 6)
python
Copy code
def extract_page_text(pdf_path, page_numbers):
    doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    text_by_page = {}
    for page_num in page_numbers:
        page = doc.load_page(page_num)
        text_by_page[page_num] = page.get_text()
    return text_by_page

page_texts = extract_page_text(pdf_path, [2, 6])
b. Process and Parse Data from Page 2 (Unemployment Data)
Once you have the text from page 2, use text processing techniques (such as regular expressions or keyword-based extraction) to find the unemployment data based on degree type.

Conclusion
By implementing the RAG pipeline with the steps described above, you can build a system that extracts, stores, and retrieves data from PDFs, generates responses to user queries, and compares data across documents. This approach leverages embeddings for efficient retrieval and uses a language model for accurate, context-aware responses.
